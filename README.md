# The Deep End

This is the source code for *The Deep End*, a small game I wrote in 2024 for a small game jam hosted by a friend.

### Game Premise

You, a sorcerer, have decided to go trick or treating underground. Although nobody is there, there's candies below, for... some reason.  So greedily, you go in and try to get as many as you can.

There is no escape. You can't come back. So you make the last moments count by taking as many candies as you can!  The journey is treacherous, filled with perils which you must avoid.

I realize that the initial story is a bit somber. The goal is basically to get as high of a score, and as deep, as possible, before you inevitably kick the bucket.

How far deep can you go?

### Having trouble opening the game?

Perhaps the version of the XNA Framework provided doesn't cut it. Try installing the Microsoft XNA Framework 4.0 Redistributable, deleting the Microsoft.Xna.Framework.X DLLs from this directory, and trying to run the game again.

If that doesn't work, get in touch with me, we'll sort it out.
